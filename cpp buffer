/* In a standard read-in (keyboard typed answer via "cin") the program will only act on the first
part of your answer. For example, in Version 1 of this program if you answer with "Joe Smith" if 
will only use the parts of your answer before the first blank space.  That means in the first part
it will only print "Joe" and not "Joe Smith".  However, the " Smith" is not ignored and erased.
The leading blank space is stripped off and the rest is placed in the buffer for later use.  In
Version 2, we see how it is them accessed and printed.

// VERSION 1
int main()
{	
    string name;  // this should have been put at the top, not on the second line of main

    cout << "What is your name? ";
    cin >> name;
  	cout << "Hello, " << name << endl << "And what is yours? ";
   	cin >> name;
    cout << "Hello, " << name  << "; nice to meet you too!" << endl;
   	return 0;
}

// VERSION 2
int main(){

  return 0;
}
// bedtime - finish this later
